# MVP Scope Refinement Checklist

**Purpose:** Validate that MVP scope is truly minimal and viable

---

## 1. Minimal Test Validation

- [ ] Each MVP feature passes "What breaks if we remove this?" test
- [ ] Each MVP feature is needed to prove the core concept
- [ ] No features can be removed without breaking core value
- [ ] MVP is the smallest set that delivers value

---

## 2. Viability Validation

- [ ] MVP proves the core concept
- [ ] Users can achieve primary goal with MVP
- [ ] MVP validates key assumptions
- [ ] Early adopters would find MVP useful
- [ ] MVP is enough to test product-market fit

---

## 3. Scope Creep Prevention

- [ ] No "nice-to-have" features in MVP
- [ ] No future features disguised as MVP
- [ ] No competitive features that don't align with core value
- [ ] No premature optimization or over-engineering
- [ ] No edge case solutions in MVP

---

## 4. Clear Boundaries

- [ ] MVP features clearly listed with rationale
- [ ] Growth features explicitly marked and deferred
- [ ] Vision features clearly marked as future
- [ ] Out-of-scope items explicitly listed
- [ ] Boundaries are unambiguous

---

## 5. Success Criteria

- [ ] MVP success criteria are specific and measurable
- [ ] Success criteria align with core value proposition
- [ ] Success criteria are achievable with MVP scope
- [ ] Success criteria don't require features beyond MVP

---

## 6. Documentation Quality

- [ ] Refined scope is clearly documented
- [ ] Rationale for each MVP feature is provided
- [ ] Changes from original scope are explained
- [ ] Next steps are clearly defined

---

## Critical Failures (Auto-Fail)

If ANY of these are true, MVP scope needs more work:

- [ ] ❌ MVP includes features that can be removed without breaking core value
- [ ] ❌ MVP doesn't prove the core concept
- [ ] ❌ MVP success criteria require features beyond MVP
- [ ] ❌ Boundaries between MVP/Growth/Vision are unclear
- [ ] ❌ Scope creep patterns are present in MVP

---

## Validation Summary

- **Pass Rate ≥ 95%:** ✅ EXCELLENT - MVP scope is refined and ready
- **Pass Rate 85-94%:** ⚠️ GOOD - Minor adjustments needed
- **Pass Rate 70-84%:** ⚠️ FAIR - Important issues to address
- **Pass Rate < 70%:** ❌ POOR - Significant rework required

---

**Remember:** MVP must be BOTH minimal AND viable. If it's minimal but not viable, it won't prove the concept. If it's viable but not minimal, it will take too long to build and validate.
